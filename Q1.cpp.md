**Overview**

This code implements a simple task management system that assigns tasks to team members based on their skill sets and the task's requirements. The system uses a queue to store the tasks and a team of team members, and assigns tasks to team members in a round-robin fashion, considering the time quantum and the remaining execution time of the tasks.

**Classes**

**Task**

The `Task` class represents a task that needs to be completed. It has the following attributes:

- `name`: The name of the task.
- `type`: The type of task.
- `priority`: The priority of the task.
- `requiredSkillSet`: The skill set required to complete the task.
- `totalCompletionTime`: The total time required to complete the task.
- `remainingExecutionTime`: The remaining time required to complete the task.

**TeamMember**

The `TeamMember` class represents a member of the team. It has the following attributes:

- `name`: The name of the team member.
- `skillSet`: The skill set of the team member.

**TaskManagementSystem**

The `TaskManagementSystem` class manages the tasks and the team members. It has the following attributes:

- `taskQueue`: A queue of tasks that need to be completed.
- `teamMembers`: An array of team members.
- `teamSize`: The number of team members.
- `currentMemberIndex`: The index of the current team member.

**Usage**

To use the task management system, you first need to create a `TaskManagementSystem` object. You can then add tasks to the system using the `addTask()` method, and add team members using the `addTeamMember()` method. Once you have added tasks and team members, you can assign tasks to team members using the `assignTasks()` method.

The following code shows an example of how to use the task management system:

```cpp
TaskManagementSystem system;

// Add team members
system.addTeamMember({"Kashif", "Software Engineer"});
system.addTeamMember({"Bilal", "Software Tester"});
system.addTeamMember({"Salal", "Project Manager"});
system.addTeamMember({"Mini", "Software Engineer"});
system.addTeamMember({"Usman", "Software Tester"});
system.addTeamMember({"Huzi", "Project Manager"});

// Add tasks with total completion time
system.addTask({"Task 1", "Software Development", 1, "Software Engineer", 10});
system.addTask({"Task 2", "Software Testing", 2, "Software Tester", 6});
system.addTask({"Task 3", "Project Management", 3, "Project Manager", 7});

// Assign tasks
system.assignTasks();
```

This code will create a task management system, add team members and tasks to the system, and then assign tasks to team members. The `assignTasks()` method will print the tasks that are assigned to each team member.
