## Introduction

This code provides a simulation of the classic "Dining Philosophers" problem, a synchronization problem in computer science. The code demonstrates how philosophers can dine concurrently while avoiding starvation or deadlock.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of threading and multi-threading concepts
- C++11 or later
- POSIX-compliant operating system (e.g., Linux, macOS)

## Program Overview

### Constants

- `NUM_TABLES`: Number of tables in the dining room üî¢
- `SEATS_PER_TABLE`: Number of seats at each table üçΩÔ∏è
- `TOTAL_PHILOSOPHERS`: Total number of philosophers dining üë´
- `FOOD_QUANTITY`: Initial quantity of food available in the bowl üç≤

### Global Variables

- `forkMutex`: Array of mutexes representing forks üç¥
- `tableSem`: Array of semaphores representing tables üçΩÔ∏è
- `foodBowlSem`: Semaphore representing the food bowl ü•£

### Philosopher Function

Each philosopher is represented by a separate thread and follows a sequence of actions:

- **Thinking**: Philosophers think for a random amount of time.
- **Pick up left fork**: Philosophers lock the left fork using a mutex.
- **Pick up right fork**: Philosophers acquire the table semaphore and lock the right fork.
- **Eating**: Philosophers eat for a random amount of time, decreasing the food quantity.
- **Release forks**: Philosophers unlock the forks and release the table semaphore.

### Main Function

- Initializes semaphores for tables and the food bowl.
- Creates philosopher threads.
- Joins philosopher threads.
- Destroys semaphores.

## Example Usage

```cpp
#include "dining_philosophers.h"

int main() {
  // Set the number of philosophers and other constants
  // ...

  // Initialize the simulation and start philosopher threads
  startSimulation();

  // Wait for all philosophers to finish dining
  joinSimulation();

  return 0;
}
```

## Additional Notes

- The simulation duration can be adjusted by changing the `FOOD_QUANTITY` constant.
- The philosophers' behavior (e.g., thinking and eating time) is simulated using random delays.
- This code uses mutexes and semaphores for synchronization, ensuring that philosophers don't starve or deadlock.
