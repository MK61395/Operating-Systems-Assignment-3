## Introduction 

This internal code documentation provides a detailed overview of the multithreaded bank transaction system, including its functionality, implementation, and usage. It serves as a valuable resource for team members involved in maintaining and enhancing the system.

## Prerequisites 

To fully understand and utilize this codebase, it is essential to have a working knowledge of the following:

- C++ programming language
- Multithreading concepts
- Mutex synchronization primitives
- Standard Template Library (STL)

## Usage

The bank transaction system is designed to facilitate various types of financial transactions, including:

- Transferring funds between accounts
- Deducting transaction fees
- Updating transaction history
- Sending email notifications

To use the system, developers can follow these steps:

1. Include the necessary header files and libraries.
2. Create mutexes for each account to ensure synchronization.
3. Define functions for each type of transaction, such as `deductFromAccount()`, `addToAccount()`, etc.
4. Create threads for each transaction and pass relevant data as arguments.
5. Join the threads to wait for them to finish.
6. Print the final account balances or perform any other necessary post-processing tasks.

## Implementation 

The bank transaction system is implemented using a multithreaded approach to handle concurrent transactions efficiently. Each transaction type is executed in a separate thread, ensuring that multiple transactions can be processed simultaneously. Mutexes are utilized to synchronize access to shared data structures, such as account balances, preventing race conditions and ensuring data integrity. 

The following table summarizes the key implementation details:

| Feature | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Multithreading | POSIX threads (pthreads) |
| Synchronization | Mutex locks |
| Transaction Functions | Separate functions for each transaction type |
| Data Structures | Arrays for account balances |
| Input/Output | Standard input/output streams and file I/O |

## Testing 

To ensure the reliability and accuracy of the bank transaction system, thorough testing is crucial. The following testing strategies are employed:

- Unit testing for individual functions and modules
- Integration testing to verify the interactions between different components
- Performance testing to assess the system's scalability and response time under load
- Manual testing to simulate real-world usage scenarios

## Deployment

The bank transaction system can be deployed in various environments, including:

- Local development machines
- Test servers
- Production servers

The deployment process involves:

1. Compiling the codebase
2. Installing the necessary dependencies
3. Configuring the system parameters
4. Deploying the system to the target environment

## Support 

For any technical assistance or clarification regarding the bank transaction system, developers can reach out to the following support channels:

- Internal documentation and code comments
- Team discussions and code reviews
- Issue tracking system
- Dedicated support engineers

## Future Development 

The bank transaction system is designed with extensibility and future development in mind. Planned enhancements include:

- Adding support for additional transaction types
- Integrating with external services, such as payment gateways
- Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction

## Glossary 

- **Mutex**: A synchronization primitive that ensures exclusive access to shared resources.
- **Race Condition**: A situation where multiple threads access and modify shared data concurrently, leading to unpredictable results.
- **Deadlock**: A situation where two or more threads wait indefinitely for each other to release resources.
