## Purpose

This C++ program is designed to process student data, calculating the average grade of all students, identifying students who need counseling based on a threshold, and sorting the students in descending order by their grades.

## Shared Data

- `studentData`: An array of `Student` structs containing data for each student, including name, roll number, main course, and grade.
- `averageGrade`: A float variable to store the calculated average grade of all students.
- `counselingThreshold`: An integer constant representing the grade threshold below which students are considered in need of counseling.
- `studentsNeedCounseling`: An array of `Student` structs to store students who need counseling.
- `sortedStudents`: An array of `Student` structs to store students sorted by their grades.

## Synchronization

To ensure thread safety and prevent race conditions, the following mutexes are used:

- `dataMutex`: Protects access to the `studentData` array
- `avgGradeMutex`: Protects access to the `averageGrade` variable
- `counselingMutex`: Protects access to the `studentsNeedCounseling` array
- `sortingMutex`: Protects access to the `sortedStudents` array
- `sortedStudentsMutex`: Protects access to the `sortedStudents` array when writing to the sorted_students.txt file

## Threads

- **Process A (calculateAverageGrade)**: Calculates the average grade of all students and stores it in the `averageGrade` variable.
- **Process B (findStudentsNeedCounseling)**: Iterates through the student data, identifies students with grades below the `counselingThreshold`, and stores them in the `studentsNeedCounseling` array.
- **Process C (sortStudents)**: Copies the student data to the `sortedStudents` array, sorts it in descending order based on grades, and stores the sorted data in the sorted_students.txt file.

## Output

The program outputs the following information:

- Average grade of all students
- List of students who need counseling
- Sorted list of students stored in the sorted_students.txt file

## Example Usage

```cpp
// Read student data from a file
ifstream inputFile("student_data.txt");

// Initialize student data
int studentCount = 0;
while (getline(inputFile, line) && studentCount < MAX_STUDENTS) {
    istringstream iss(line);
    Student& student = studentData[studentCount];
    iss >> student.name >> student.rollNumber >> student.mainCourse >> student.grade;
    ++studentCount;
}

// Create and start threads
pthread_t avgGradeThread, counselingThread, sortingThread;
pthread_create(&avgGradeThread, nullptr, calculateAverageGrade, nullptr);
pthread_create(&counselingThread, nullptr, findStudentsNeedCounseling, nullptr);
pthread_create(&sortingThread, nullptr, sortStudents, nullptr);

// Wait for threads to finish
pthread_join(avgGradeThread, nullptr);
pthread_join(counselingThread, nullptr);
pthread_join(sortingThread, nullptr);

// Output results
cout << "Average Grade: " << averageGrade << endl;

cout << "Students needing counseling:" << endl;
for (int i = 0; i < MAX_STUDENTS; ++i) {
    cout << studentsNeedCounseling[i].name << " - " << studentsNeedCounseling[i].grade << endl;
}

cout << "Sorted Students have been stored in 'sorted_students.txt'." << endl;
